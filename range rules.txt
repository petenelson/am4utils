These two rules basically common knowledge in AM4:
F-class seats are the most profitable ones, followed by J and Y class seats.
The optimal ticket price is Y-autoprice *1.1; J-autoprice *1.08; F-autoprice*1.06

But what if I told you the first one is actually wrong? Well, not completely wrong, but not 100% right either.
To understand that, we have to understand the first rule. First class seats are more profitable due to the higher base value in the ticket formula (the "b" in the ax+b formula); the base value of the first class ticket prices is higher than 3x the basis value of the economy class ticket prices.
Realism: 1000 (F) > 150 (Y) * 3; Easy: 1200 (F) > 170 (Y) * 3

However we multiply the Y-class autoprice by 1.1, while multiplying the F-class autoprice by 1.06
-> If your route is long enough, Y-class and J-class will be more profitable than F-class.

The exact data is this:
However, keep in mind the “border” is quite inaccurate, at distances ±10km around the border there will be two classes which will make the same profit.

Realism:
If distance <13889km, use the standard formula (F>J>Y)
If distance >13889km but <15694km: J>F>Y
If distance >15694km but <17500km: J>Y>F
If distance >17500km: Y>J>F
~13889km: J ≈ F
~15694km: Y ≈ F
~17500km: Y ≈ J
