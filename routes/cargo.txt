-A plane with 100% large load configuration will have 70% of the original capacity (If the original capacity is 100,000lbs, 100% Large Load will have 70,000lbs capacity)
-Large Load is more profitable than Heavy Load
-Cargo demand is based on PAX demand: Large Load demand = Y-Class demand x 500; Heavy Load demand = J-Class demand x 1000.

f) Good Planes (Cargo)
Start with cargo:
-A400M
-B757-200F
2nd stage:
-IL-96T
-A330-200F
3rd stage:
-B747-400F
-B747-8F
End game:
-A380-800F
-An225
The An-124 is not more profitable than the 747-8F because itâ€™s so slow.

Cargo: Multiply the auto-price by 1.1 for Large Load and 1.08 for Heavy Load. Round down to 0.01
